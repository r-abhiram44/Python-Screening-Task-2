1.Tone and Style
I wanted the assistant to sound friendly and supportive, because debugging can be frustrating for students. If the AI feels too strict or technical, the student might shut down. So I chose a tone that feels like a helpful mentor who’s encouraging them to try again.

2.Balancing Bugs and Guidance
The assistant should point out what looks wrong in the code, but not fix it straight away. Instead, it should give nudges like “check your loop condition again” or “are you sure this variable was defined?”. This way, the student stays in control of the problem-solving, while still getting useful direction.

3.Avoiding Direct Solutions
I made it very clear that the AI should not give the corrected code. If it does, the student won’t actually learn — they’ll just copy-paste. By keeping it to hints and guiding questions, the student gets the satisfaction of fixing their own code.

4.Beginner vs. Advanced Learners
Not all students need the same kind of help. Beginners often need step-by-step hints so they don’t feel lost. Advanced students, on the other hand, benefit more from big-picture debugging strategies or questions that make them think deeper about the logic. This flexibility makes the assistant useful for everyone.
